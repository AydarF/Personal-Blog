<b>The Big-O Notation</b> is a tool that lets us determine the complexity (the number of operations) of an algorithm, helping us measure the performance of a specific algorithm. (For example: O(n). O is the growth rate of the function and n is the length of the list/array to be sorted).  This notation measures the worst case scenario of how quickly the runtime grows when the input gets large. In other words, Big O helps us to determine how long an algorithm takes to run.

The main Big-O terms are:

O(1) - Constant

O(n) - Linear

O(n ^ 2) - Quadratic

O(log n) - Logarithmic

O(2 ^ n) - Exponential
<br />

<b>Constant  - O(1): </b>Your algorithm will run the same, no matter how many elements there are in your list/arr
<br />

<Charts data={[30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30]} />

```js
function printTheFirstElementOfTheArray(arrayOfItems){
    console.log(arrayOfItems[0]); // will always print the first element of the array no matter how big the array is;
}
 printTheFirstElementOfTheArray([0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]); // 0

```
<br />

<b>Linear - O(n):</b>  The performance of O(n) algorithm will grow in direct proportion (linearly) to the size of the input. 
In other words, the more elements there are in your array, the more time it will take for your algorithm to run. 
A common example is a loop function. 
<br />
<Charts data={[0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]} />

```js
let employees = ["Mark", "El", "Jo"];
function printAllEmployees(arrayOfElements) {
    for(let i = 0; i < arrayOfElements.length; i++){
		console.log(arrayOfElements[i]);
}
}
printAllEmployees(employees); // Mark, El, Jo

```
<br />

<b>Quadratic - O(n^2):</b> Quadratic time complexity is an algorithm whose runtime is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input. 
You can find examples in nested loops. 
If the array has n items, the outer loop runs n times and the inner loops runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop resulting in n^2.
<br />
<Charts data={[1, 2, 4, 66, 356, 800]} />

```js
function arrayOfItems(array){
    	for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        		for(let k = 0; k < array.length; k++){
            		console.log(i,k);
        		}
    	}
} 
arrayOfItems([1,2,3,4,5]); 
```
<br />

<b>Logarithmic - O(log (n)):</b> The runtime it takes for the algorithm to run will flatten out by every step of the code's execution despite the size of the input. 
This is considered to be the most efficient way of handling large sets of data. For example, if your function takes 1 second to execute the input size of 100, 
it will take 2 seconds to execute the input size of 1000, 3 seconds the input size of 10000 and so on. 
The perfect example of the implementation of this algorithm would be a binary search. A binary search cuts the array size in half with each operation.
A good explanation of using a binary search tree in JavaScript could be found <a target="_blank" href="https://initjs.org/implement-a-binary-search-tree-in-javascript-952a44ee7c26">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
<Charts data={[0, 180, 200, 200, 200, 200]} />

<b>Exponential - O(2^n):</b> The runtime of the algorithm doubles with each addition to the input. 
If 1 item takes 100 seconds to execute, 2 items would  take 200 seconds, 3 items would take 300 seconds and so on. 
A good example is calculating Fibonacci numbers recursively.  

<br />
<Charts data={[0, 50, 370, 800]} />

```js
function fibonacci (num){
	if (num <= 1){
	    return 1;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(num - 2) + fibonacci(num -1);
    }
}
```
