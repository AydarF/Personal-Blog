Recursive function is a function that returns itself until a specified condition is met. Calling a function is not necessarily free.
If you start calling a function 100, 200, 500 times that does carry a cost, especially with memory, since your computer now has to keep track of all these calls.
If you have a recursion that keeps on going forever, 
your computer is gonna freak out and then explode, that’s stack overflow 
(A stack overflow is an undesirable condition in which a particular computer program tries to use more memory space than the call stack has available). 

The first line of any recursion is the base case. The base case is when you stop recursion. 
The reason why it is first is you tell the function when to stop. If you don’t tell the function when to stop you’ll end up with stack overflow.   

The classic examples of recursion are “calculating the nth Fibonacci number" and "finding the nth Factorial number".

According to Wikipedia:
<blockquote>Fibonacci numbers form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.</blockquote>
<br /> 
This is what that looks like in code using a for loop:

```js
function fibonacci(){
	let a = 0, b = 1, f = 1;
	for(let i = 0; i <= n; i++){
		f = a + b;
		a = b;
		b = f
	}
		return f;
}
```

Using recursion:

```js
function fibonacci(n){
	if(n < 2){ 	// you could do n === 0 or n === 1 but you wanna guard yourself from anyone adding a negative number
		return 1;
	} else {
		return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
	}
}
```

Note: 1 is a given number in fibonacci sequence.

According to Wikipedia Factorial is:
<br />
<blockquote>the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, 
is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
This is what that looks like in code:

```js
function factorial(num){
	if(num < 2){
		return 1; 
	} else {
		return num * factorial(num - 1);
	}
}
```
Note: you can think of a recursive function’s body as a loop, whatever is inside the body is going to be looped over a bunch of times.
