React Hooks have been around for more than a year now but it's still 
exciting every time you use them.

With the advent of React Hooks, the use of class components is not crucial anymore. 
That said, according to the React team, the class components will still stick around for quite a while.

React Hooks are a way to use state and other React features within functional components. 

We'll start with the <b><mark>useState</mark></b> hook. useState is a hook that lets you add and update React state to functional components. 

First, we import useState hook from React. Then we simply call it, since it's just a function.

```js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
const App = () = {
    useState();
    return (
        <div></div>
    )
}

export default App;
```
The useState hook accepts an argument which is the initial value of the state property and returns 
the current value of the state property and a method to update that state property. 

The useState hook returns an array. Therefore, you're supposed to use 
[array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
when you get the value of the useState hook. 

```js
const [currentValue, method] = useState(initial value);
``` 
The first value in the array that the useState hook returns is what you're saving in the state
and the second value is the function to change/update that value. 

You can use any names for the current value variable and the method. The useState hook is not aware of 
what you're going to call your items, that is it doesn't know what kind of state you're saving. 

```js
const [animal, setAnimal] = useState('Christmas Armadillo');
```
To avoid confusion, though, it's better to use meaningful variables, e.g.

```js
const [count, setAnimal] = useState(0);
```
It's an unofficial naming convention to start the name of the method with 'set'.

The very first time the component renders a state variable is created and initiated with 
the default value of 0: <b>useState(0)</b>. The default value is never used on re-renders.

Full example:

```js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
const CounterHook = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>Count</button>
        </div>
    )
}
export default CounterHook;
```

For better readability, you can create other functions (that are changing/updating the state) 
inside of your main component:
```js
import React, {useState} from 'react';
const CounterHook = () => {
    let initialValue = 0;
    const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
    const increment = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    const decrement = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1);
    const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
            <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
        </div>
    )
}
export default CounterHook;
```

That's it for now. I'll most likely add some extra use cases later on :)
